title: "joy is focus"

I grew up on a three acre stretch of land, in a civil war era farmhouse sitting in the liminial space between corn fields and suburban Chicago sprawl. My family did not have a TV or internet (to be fair -- at the time few did), my dad had a cell phone the size of brick, and I was homeschooled. This meant my days were spent on a few things:

**Wandering around a pine forest**. Sometimes I'd simply lie down in a bed of pine needles to listen to the wind going through the trees (broken by cars passing by) or see how sunlight changed as it filtered through the layers of tree canopy above.

**Digging trenches**. I picked a part of our back lot that was weedy and never used and chose and would spend hours just digging trenches. Sometimes they were combat trenches, sometimes a spot for buried tresure. I don't know why this was so much fun but I'd spent entire days hacking away at the stubborn clay filled soil.

**Devouring books**. My room had shelves and shelves of books, stacked in crates, falling innumerable brick-a-brack bookends, spilling out into the floor. I'd pick a book, read it, and then pick another. I had nothing better to do. Looking back, I don't think there was anything better I could have been doing.

Depending on who you are, that may seem an idyllic pastoral existence or absolute hell. I think there is a part of me that didn't know anything else, and had no point of reference to make me unsatisfied, but I would argue that a lot of that joy came simply from a lack of distraction. I have read so many articles about trying to "be present" and achieve some Zen-like state of performance or concentration and I think those days were brimming with that practice. I wasn't swarmed by a 24 hour news cycle; sucked in by a steady drip of social media feeds; or buried under a catch up list of shows, podcasts, and articles. I just had a forest, a hole-flecked field, and crates of books.

## Now

While there were downsides -- primarily loneliness -- I long more for those days joyful solitude and peace than for the stimuli circus of my college and high-school days. Now, My world is filled with feeds, buzzes and bleeps, and a constant sense of being out of the loop.

Often I find myself countering this excess with _more_: looking at my phone and reading an article while I'm watching a show that's only mildly interesting; listening to music while driving and trying to talk with my wife or kids. Hopping between Slack, and my code editor, and Figma, and my browser. The more I pull down to refresh the feed of my life, the scattered and spent I feel.

Real happiness, as much as we can get in this life at least, comes from those unexpected moments that you are only able to experience by being fully present. For me sometimes it's noticing the shape of the clouds on a sunny day, sometimes it's laughing at one of my kids corny jokes at dinner, it's singing a hymn with the other members of my church. These are all a return to building those small, fundamental "core memory" moments. That's something that I have not found in all my online adventures or career ladder climbing.

## Next

As I look forward, I am trying to figure out a way to re-claim more of that focus in my day-to-day life. This is tricky, because I am also a Software Engineer so the bleeps and blubs are how I make my living -- and I love technology too much to throw it away entirely.But, I also understand how much being in the industry -- and relying on my computer and phone -- encourage diffusing ones focus. I'll share more about the strategies and mindset I'm trying to adopt in a subsequent post, but the `tldr;` is that I am trying to slowly walk away from pursuing distraction, and starting to limit it.

I'm assuming my small readership is almost entirely in the software field, so I'm curious if this has touched a nerve or seems irrelevant.
