In my [previous post](https://nick-tomlin.com/posts/joy-is-focus) I talked about wanting to return to a simpler more focused state of being. This post discusses some practical ways i'm attempting to do that, while stil being a passionate technologist.

Disclaimer: everybody is differnt and this list isn't supposed to indicate to value judgements on you. I do believe that we would all be better by removing distractions from our lives, but the what and how is up to you :smile:

## Philosophy: pursue structural changes

I have small children, and I hate waking up earlier than they do, so my routine is largely driven by their schedule, not mine. Because of this, Basic Atomic habits style stacking is the _ceiling_ for how much structure I put in place. In general, I like to try to eliminate as many things up front, with structure or automation, versus having rules or patterns that require a lot of in-the-moment willpower.

# ️Phone habits

My phone is the biggest source of distraction in my life, which is incredibly tricky because it is also one of the most useful things I own.

## No phone mornings

This is an on-again-off-again habit, but one i've found to b

## Phone shelf

It's a lot easier to not be distracted by your phone if it isn't on your person. I try to put the phone on a shelf (ideally around a corner out of sight) or in my office.

## Work makes this tricky

I have a regular on-call rotation, so I there are weeks where having my phone on or near me is a necessity. I try to make those weeks an exception, and

# 2️⃣ No feeds

While it's easy to scapegoat technology for everything, I do think engagement driven feeds are generally a net negative for the world. I try to minimize and avoid them as much a possible. Here's how:

## Social audit

After a few years of trying to limit usage, I finally deleted my Facebook account and idled my X/Twitter/Instagram accounts. This avoids the lure of "I wonder what my friends are up to" that inevitably leads to doomscrolling an infinite feed of junk or me wondering why i'm not living my best life vineyard hopping in Chile.

I haven't regretted a second.

### Reddit w/ "one weird trick"

I know I just said "no socials" but here me out: I'd previously avoided Reddit due to toxic/doomscrool reasons, but I recently discovered custom feed options that are life changing.

- I defaulted my iOs feed to _just_ my custom feed (grilling, electronics repair, the Chicago food scene)
- I enabled 'text only' mode for the feed, to remove distracting pictures

So far, I've used it to help fix a lawnmower, repair some of my kid's toys, and find new restaurants in Chicago and beyond. Because my feed is scoped to relatively slow moving and boring redits, I can often clear it in a couple minutes and end up bored enough to go and do something else.

### LinkedIn (w/ extensions)

LinkedIn is the most "social" social networking I do, and I've gotten a lot of value out of it as a way of connecting with old friends, classmates, and folks from my Alma Mater.
Over time, it's started to push feeds with hot takes and click bait and started to feel a lot more like business casual Twitter.

For awhile I wholesale blocked LinkedIn, but missed the the actual networking pieces. As compromise: i've put a few countermeasures in place to try and make things more calm:

- A tampermonkey extension to hide [notification badges](https://gist.github.com/NickTomlin/9f5708c1fa2c7e40334fabee6ec0a2fb)
- A tampermonkey script to remove the [`/feed`](https://gist.github.com/JesperDramsch/839365c85133927f694bf5113c77a2f1)

So far this has helped me getting stuck scrolling the feed or getting distracted by engagement baiting notifications. I'll whole

## Making the news come to me

Starting in 2020, I began to spend way too much time reading the news. This was a combo of having sites on speed dial in my browser home tab and obsessively refreshing the apple news app (which is it's own feed hellscape).

Now, I've pivoted to more passive ways of getting info:

- Newsletters: Substack and a few technology weekly (JSBytes, JSWeekly, etc).
- My work slack interest channels
- Fiends who have better self control than I do.

Note: the SubStack app -- unfortunately -- leans into the algorithmic feed model and is a complete distraction. I would not recommend installing it. I wish they would reverse direction here, but I understand that the money is in engagement and a feed is a great way of driving that.

# ️Ordinary time

Spending less time scrolling is one thing, but it's easy to pour that time into more work, or playing videogames (which I love too much to entirely eliminate) or busywork.

## Be bored and awkward

This relates to phone usage, but I try to not use my phone in public:

- Sitting in a waiting room
- Riding public transit/ride share
- Waiting for a dinner companion to come back from the rest room

It's awkward, but it has two primary benefits: it's a small meaningful choice that helps me say "no" the next time I want to reach for my phone; it can be a built in time of reflection/meditation/presence.

## Pursuing slow burn dopamine

Media is often a short cut to a nice hit of dopamine, it's super fun (and easy) to level up in an RPG but a lot harder to -- say -- hit an archery target in real life.

One of the things that is challenging about "free time" for a perfectionist like me is not only is it hard and imperfect to learn new things, but the satisfaction of doing something is often delayed until you've built some competence.

The analogy I have is similar to ultra processed foods. It's tasty, and easy, to grab some chips and munch on them, versus cooking a healthier snack, and honestly i'd often prefer some cheetos over Quinoa. But... the payoff for cooking a meal is much deeper and richer.
